# vsync-toggle

App for Windows to toggle VSync via command line. This is just a simple edit of FrogTheFrog's [gsync-toggle](https://github.com/FrogTheFrog/gsync-toggle/), but for VSync.

# How to use

Run the app in terminal for usage instruction, but in case you're lazy:
```
  Usage example:
    vsynctoggle status    prints the current VSync status
    vsynctoggle default   lets the game decide the VSync status
    vsynctoggle off       turns VSync off
    vsynctoggle on        turns VSync on
    vsynctoggle fast      turns VSync on with Fast Sync
    vsynctoggle half      turns VSync on at 1/2 rate
    vsynctoggle third     turns VSync on at 1/3 rate
    vsynctoggle quarter   turns VSync on at 1/4 rate
```
